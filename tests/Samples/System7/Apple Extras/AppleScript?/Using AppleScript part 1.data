Use it to begin working with AppleScript. You can use AppleScript on Macintosh computers that use system software version 7.0 or later. If you’re new to the Macintosh, read the information that came with your computer before you install the AppleScript application program. You’ll need to know basic Macintosh operations and vocabulary to use AppleScript. What is AppleScript?When you use your Macintosh computer, you use the mouse and keyboard to open documents and application programs, move documents and file folders, enter information, print, and perform any other actions you want. AppleScript gives you a whole new way to work: You can give the computer a list of things you want it to do—a script—and let the computer do everything on your list. You can create a script by simply turning on the recorder and performing a set of actions. AppleScript keeps a list of what you do while the recorder is turned on. When you turn the recorder off, you can see the recorded script. When you run the script, your computer repeats your actions automatically.You can use the Finder and many application programs with AppleScript. Scripts can make the Finder or the program do many things for you. For example, a script might format a letter the way you want, save it in a particular folder, and print it. You can also use AppleScript to combine the capabilities of application programs. For example, a script might use the calculation capabilities of a spreadsheet and the formatting capabilities of a word processor to assemble an invoice.Scriptable application programs and the Scriptable FinderYou can create scripts to control any scriptable application programs you have installed on your Macintosh. An application is scriptable when you can use AppleScript to control it. Many Macintosh programs are scriptable. If you’re not sure your program is scriptable, contact the program’s manufacturer for information.With system software version 7.5, the Finder (inside the System Folder) is scriptable. When you begin working with the Script Editor, you can use the Finder to try recording and playing a script. About this guideThis guide tells you how to use the Script Editor to record scripts and how to change a script to do something different. The Script Editor is an application program you use to open and run scripts, make new scripts by recording or writing them, and save scripts. You don’t need to know how to write computer programs to do anything described in this manual. Balloon HelpYou can use Balloon Help with the application program that come with AppleScript (the Script Editor). Choose Show Balloons from the Guide menu (near the right end of the menu bar). When you point to any feature of the Script Editor application program, a balloon appears explaining the feature.Where to go from hereFor more information about using the Script Editor to work with scripts, open the file called "Using AppleScript part 2” to see Chapter 1 (“Using the Script Editor") and Chapter 2 (“Script Editor Command Reference”).If you wish to create more complex scripts, see an authorized Apple dealer for information about the AppleScript Scripter’s Kit. The Scripter’s Kit contains additional AppleScript software and manuals.
