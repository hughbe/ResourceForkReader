ð  About Automated TasksWhat are Automated Tasks?Automated Tasks are AppleScript scripts that perform tasks in the Finder. To run a script (and perform its task), you  can either choose the script from the Apple menu or activate the script in the Automated Tasks folder. The Automated Tasks folder is located in the AppleScript folder (inside the Apple Extras folder) on your hard disk. How to Run the ScriptsThe list below describes the task each script performs. It also tells you how to run the script from the Apple menu and from the Automated Tasks folder.  Some scripts may not work with all Macintosh models.Add Alias to Apple Menu creates an alias for an item and puts the alias in the Apple Menu Items folder. (For more information on aliases, see the manual that came with your computer.)   ¥ To use the script from the Apple menu:  Select the item for which to create an alias. Then open the Apple menu and choose Automated Tasks and Add Alias to Apple Menu. ¥ To use the script from the Automated Tasks folder: Open the Automated Tasks folder and drag the item's icon onto the script's icon. Find Original from Alias shows the original items of one or more aliases selected in the Finder.  ¥ To use the script from the Apple menu:  Select the alias (or aliases). Then open the Apple menu and choose Automated Tasks and Find Original from Alias. ¥ To use the script from the Automated Tasks folder: Open the Automated Tasks folder and drag the alias onto the script's icon. Share a Folder checks to see if there is a folder named Drop Folder at the top level of the startup disk.
