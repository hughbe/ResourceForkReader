ð  About More Automated TasksWhat are Automated Tasks?Automated Tasks are AppleScript scripts that perform tasks in the Finder. The More Automated Tasks folder contains scripts for tasks that Macintosh power users will find helpful. To run a script (and perform its task), you activate the script in the Automated Tasks folder. (More Automated Tasks are not available from the Apple menu.)  Some scripts may not work with all Macintosh models.How to Run the ScriptsThe list below describes the task each script performs. It also tells you how to run the script in the More Automated Tasks folder. Alert When Folder Changes tells you when an item is added to a folder. This script is useful when you are sharing a folder on a network.To use the script, you must first specify a single folder that you wish to watch. To specify the folder, drag the folder on top of the script (or double-click the script and select a folder in the dialog box). The script runs in the background while you work on other tasks. If any new items are added to the folder, the script identifies the new items in the folder. You can also modify the script to perform some other action when the folder changes.Change Monitor to 256 changes the setting in the Monitors control panel to 256 colors or grays (bit depth of 8). If the monitor does not support 256 colors or grays, you can set the monitor to the maximum supported depth. This change is temporary. The next time you start up your computer the Monitors control panel setting will revert to the earlier setting.Change Monitor to B&W changes the setting in the Monitors control panel to black and white (2 colors or grays). This change is temporary. The next time you start up your computer the Monitors control panel setting will revert to the earlier setting.Hide/Show Folder Sizes turns the Calculate folders sizes checkbox in the Views control panel on and off.Synchronize Folders compares the contents of two folders and synchronizes the contents.  For example, if there is a file called "Document 1" in folder A and a file called "Document 2" in folder B, the script copies "Document 1" to folder B and "Document 2" to folder A so that both folders contain both files. If the files in both folders have the same name, the file with the later modification date is copied to the other folder.Running Automated Tasks at Startup and ShutdownIf you want a script to run whenever you start up your computer, drag the script's icon into the Startup Items folder (inside the System Folder). If you want a script to run when you shut down your computer, drag the script's icon into the Shutdown Items folder (inside the System Folder). To run the script at shutdown, make sure you choose Restart or Shut Down from the Special menu (not from the Apple menu).May 14, 1996©1996  Apple Computer.
