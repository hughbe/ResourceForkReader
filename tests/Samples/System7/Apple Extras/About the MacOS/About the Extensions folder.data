Macintosh System 7.5.3What’s Inside the Extensions Folder?About this documentIf you’re curious about the contents of the Extensions folder, this document provides a brief description of each extension. You can use these descriptions to help determine which extensions you may need and which ones you may not need.What is an extension? An extension is a small file that changes how your computer operates. Unlike a control panel, you typically do not have any direct interaction with an extension. An extension makes the appropriate changes when you start your computer and remains active until you shut down your computer. Depending on the type of computer you have, the contents of your Extensions folder may vary. You might have extensions that were added by third-party applications, and you don’t need to have all the extensions described below. You can use the Extensions Manager control panel to turn off any extension you don’t need.9500 Guide Additions: Adds step-by-step instructions for using features specific to the Power Macintosh 9500 to the onscreen help provided in Macintosh Guide.
