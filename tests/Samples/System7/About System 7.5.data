This is normal for the Any Macintosh option.  Do not delete one or both of these enablers.•   If you use the Custom Install option to install a system for Any Macintosh, the Monitors & Sound control panel, the Monitors control panel, and the Sound control panel are all installed.  This is normal for the Any Macintosh option, as some computers use the Monitors & Sound control panel, and some use the separate Monitors control panel and Sound control panel.   •  If you install system software version 7.5.3 on a Quadra 630, the Screen control panel is installed even though this control panel will not work on your computer.  •  If you install system software version 7.5.3 on a Power Macintosh 6100, the AutoPower On/Off and the CPU Energy Saver control panels are installed even though these control panels will not work on your computer. General information about system software version 7.5.3System software version 7.5.3 provides the enhancements introduced in System 7.5, System 7.5 Update 1.0, System 7.5 Update 2.0, and System 7.5.3 Revision 2.The Installer places the latest versions of all components it finds on the disk it is updating, including any components that you disabled using the Extensions Manager. After you run the Installer, the updated components will be in the same folders as they were before you installed this system software version. For example, new versions of disabled extensions will be in the Extensions (Disabled) folder, and new versions of disabled control panels will be in the Control Panels (Disabled) folder. The file called System 7.5 Update replaces the enabler on all computers capable of running system software versions 7.5 and/or 7.5.1. Computers that did not previously need an enabler to work with system software versions 7.5 and 7.5.1 still need the System 7.5 Update file since it contains most of the fixes delivered in this update.The file called System 7.5.2 Update replaces the enabler file on all computers capable of running system software version 7.5.2. This system software version includes all of the fixes included with the previously released 7.5.2 Printing Update, the PowerBook 5300 System Software Update, the PowerBook 2300c Update, System 7.5 Update 2.0, and System 7.5.3 Revision 2.  You do not need these updates if you install this system software version.After you install this software, the About This Macintosh window says “System Software 7.5.3.” The window also says “Revision 2”. Using a LaserWriter LSMany LaserWriter LS users are unaware that this printer is supported by the LaserWriter 300 driver. To make this clear, this release will install this driver as the LaserWriter 300/LS. You must select LaserWriter 300/LS from the Chooser before you can print using this driver.Using the Recent Documents command in the Apple menuYou can easily open any of your most recently used documents by choosing the Recent Documents command in the Apple menu, then choosing a document from the submenu. However, this feature can increase the time it takes to open some applications. This occurs because the recent-documents tracking includes all files that are opened—even those opened by an application as part of its launch sequence (such as drop-in filters used by desktop publishing packages). You can reduce the increased opening time by turning off the recent-documents tracking. You can either: - turn off “recent documents” tracking in the Apple Menu Options control panel - turn off Apple Menu Options in the Extensions ManagerNew features in system software version 7.5.3  If you are already familiar with an earlier version of System 7.5, you should notice greater stability and performance on your computer once you install version 7.5.3.  You should also note the following new features:•	Open Transport v.1.1, a major re-implementation of the network system software for use on all 68030, 68040, and PowerPC-based computers, except the desktop 5200, 5300, 6200, and 6300 series computers. If you chose the Easy Install option, Open Transport will be turned on only if you were using it before you installed the new system software version. For more information, see the Open Transport Information folder, inside the Apple Extras folder.•  The Network Software Selector (NSS) enables users of most 68030, 68040, and early PowerPC-based computers to choose between Open Transport networking software and classic AppleTalk if both are installed. (You must restart the computer for the change to take effect.) PCI-based computers support only Open Transport. NSS is in the Apple Extras folder; information on using it is built into the application. NSS is intended to ease the transition to Open Transport by allowing you to use the older networking software if there is a compatibility problem with an application and Open Transport. Once the problem is resolved, you should switch back to Open Transport.Note: Because MacTCP is incompatible with Open Transport v.1.1, MacTCP is disabled any time Open Transport is selected using the Network Software Selector. (Open Transport uses the TCP/IP control panel instead of MacTCP.) If, however, you reselect classic AppleTalk, MacTCP will be enabled again, but you will need to re-enter the IP settings in the MacTCP control panel.•	For users of the older networking software, this update includes MacTCP 2.0.6, which	- shortens retransmission delays	- prevents potential out-of-memory errors	- makes configuring communications easier	- gives users more control over which servers to contact and in what order• When you rebuild the desktop, comments typed in a file’s Get Info window are no longer deleted.	 • The Name field (used in Finder windows set to one of the list views) is wider, allowing you to see more characters in filenames. 	• If you’re using an alias to connect to a server and your password has expired or needs to be changed, you’ll see a message that the password needs to be changed. •	PowerPC-based computers with PCI expansion slots now use the Monitors & Sound control panel, instead of the Sound & Displays control panel, to control monitor and sound settings. You can do a custom installation to install the Sound control panel if you need it for older applications.  (The Monitors & Sound control panel works only on PCI-based computers.)•	The Memory control panel now uses a larger default setting for the disk cache to increase performance.•	When you open an application by double-clicking a document, you can set the default location of saved items to the folder containing the document you opened, instead of the Documents folder or the folder containing the application. You set this preference by turning on the “Folder that is set by the application” option in the General Controls panel. • CloseView no longer uses keyboard shortcuts that were already used by the Finder. The new keyboard shortcuts for CloseView are:	- Command-Option-K: turns CloseView on or off	- Command-Option-+ (the plus sign): increases magnification	- Command-Option-- (the minus sign): decreases magnification•	SimpleText version 1.3.1 supports QuickDraw 3D.•	When file sharing is turned on, removable disks and CD-ROM discs are automatically shared (except for audio CDs, which will no longer be shared). To eject a removable disk or CD-ROM disc, you no longer have to turn off file sharing, as long as no other user is currently connected to that volume.• The Power key can now be used to turn the computer off. To shut down the computer, press the Power key. When the dialog box appears, you can shut down your computer, restart your computer, put it to sleep (if your computer supports sleep), or cancel the shutdown. PowerBook 100 series computers do not have a Power key on their built-in keyboard, but if you attach an external keyboard, you can use the keyboard’s Power key to turn off the computer. This fueature is not supported on the Macintosh Plus.• A new AppleScript automated task–Share a Folder (No Guest)–lets you automatically share a folder with the guest access disabled.•	Launcher version 2.8  includes the following fixes and enhancements, introduced in System 7.5 Update 1.0:- Supports Macintosh drag and drop, making it easier to add or remove items.    To add an item: Open the Launcher and drag the item into the Launcher window or onto a category button. The system creates a new Launcher button for the item by placing an alias in the Launcher Items folder. The original item remains on your hard disk.    To remove an item from the Launcher: Hold down the Option key and drag the button out of the Launcher.   To move a Launcher button to a new category: Hold down the Option key and drag the button to a category button along the top of the Launcher window.   To open a file using the Launcher: Drag the file’s icon onto a Launcher button that represents an application program. For example, you can open a SimpleText file by dragging its icon onto the SimpleText button. If the program the button represents can open the file, the button is highlighted when you drag the file to it.    To put a file into a folder: Drag the file’s icon onto the Launcher button that represents the folder.   To resize the currently visible Launcher buttons: Hold down the Command key and click inside the Launcher window. Then choose a new size from the pop-up menu.    To open a category button’s folder (located in the Launcher Items folder): Hold down the Option key and click the category button. Known problems and their workaroundsEthernet addressPowerPC-based computers with PCI expansion slots might have a different physical Ethernet address after you install this system software version. This software fixes a bug that caused an incorrect physical Ethernet address to be used in environments where TCP/IP addresses are obtained using BootP, DHCP, or RARP. To see the new Ethernet address after you install this software, open the File menu in the AppleTalk or TCP/IP control panel and choose Get Info. If you install this software and are no longer able to use your TCP/IP-based applications, contact your network system administrator. AppleVisionIf you use AppleVision software, use version 1.0.2 or later. Earlier versions of AppleVision are not compatible with system software version 7.5.3. 	If you have a 1710AV monitor and a PCI-based computer, use AppleVision 1.0.4 and the Monitors & Sound control panel.  If you have a 1710AV monitor and a non-PCI-based computer, use AppleVision 1.0.2, the Sound control panel, and the Monitors control panel.  When you install this system software, the correct control panels should be installed.Apple Video PlayerApple Video Player displays an incorrect dialog box if it’s opened on a computer that does not have video-in capability. Apple Video Player displays a message that the Video Startup extension was not installed properly instead a message that video-in is required for the application to run.Printing problems•  If you choose the Easy Install option, your printer driver will be updated but no new printing software will be installed.  To obtain all of the most recent printer drivers after you do an Easy Install, choose Custom Install.  Then check the Printing checkbox and click Install.• If, when you try to print, you see a message that your printing preferences are missing or damaged, or you see a message telling you there is not enough memory, open the Chooser and select a printer.•	Some versions of the LaserWriter driver (version 7.2 and earlier) and the QuickDraw GX printer drivers still have the problems that interfere with PCI-based computers trying to print on a busy printer or trying to print large documents. If you experience these problems, select the LaserWriter 8.3.2 driver from the Chooser. •  If you use a StyleWriter I or a StyleWriter II printer, the StyleWriter 1200 printer driver replaces the SytleWriter  I or StyleWriter II printer driver when you install system software version 7.5.3.  Energy Saver control panels•	Two different control panels are named “Energy Saver.” The older version worked by dimming the external screens of certain computers. The newer Energy Saver, which works differently, works only on PowerPC computers with PCI expansion slots. The universal System Folder that can be created with this release (using the Any Macintosh choice in the Custom Install option) only contains the newer Energy Saver. If your universal System Folder requires both versions of the Energy Saver, do the following:1. Rename the newer Energy Saver.2. Use the Custom Install option to install the older Energy Saver.Sound and speech•  HyperCard version 2.3.3 or earlier does not record sound properly on computers with PCI expansion slots. Other sound-recording application programs, including SimpleSound and the Sound control panel, can record sounds that you can import and play within HyperCard 2.3.•	If you have a Macintosh Centris 660AV, Quadra 660AV, or Quadra 840AV, some system alert sounds may not play correctly with the alert volume turned down. To avoid the problem, keep the alert volume turned all the way up and adjust the Built-In system volume as follows:1. Open the Sound control panel.2. Choose Volumes from the pop-up menu.3. Adjust the volume.•  If you have a PCI-based computer and you start your computer from the Disk Tools 2 disk, you cannot use the Sound control panel.  Problems starting your computerIf your computer has a 68000 processor and the computer won’t start up, try pressing the Shift key (to turn off extensions) while you restart. If there is a “Color StyleWriter 2000 CMM” file in your Extensions folder (inside the System Folder), take this file out of the Extensions folder and restart your computer. (To use the Color StyleWriter 2000 series printer, you need a 68020 or higher processor.)•	Speech version 1.4.1 can cause a Macintosh Plus (a model which does not support speech) to hang during startup. If your Macintosh Plus hangs during startup, do the following:1. Restart the computer while holding down the Space bar.2. When the Extensions Manager dialog box appears, turn off Speech.AppleShare and Speed CopyThere is an incompatibility between AppleShare Workstation software version 3.6.1 and Connectix Speed Copy (part of Speed Doubler version 1.1 or earlier). Use the Extensions Manager to turn off Speed Copy before you install this system software version, and contact Connectix to get the latest version of Speed Doubler. (You can contact Connectix at http://www.connectix.com, 415-571-5100, or 800-950-5880.) Novell NetwareThe Ethernet Compatiblity extension version 1.0.3 is installed with this system software to fix a problem in the system shutdown code that affected PCI computers connected to certain networks, such as Novell Netware. A side effect of this fix is a two-minute delay in shutting down the computer.Drive SetupIf, when using Drive Setup on some IDE hard drives, the “Update driver,” “Customize volume,” and “Test disk” options are dimmed, back up all data on the IDE disk onto another disk, and use Drive Setup to reinitialize the IDE disk. Conflict CatcherWhen using Conflict Catcher, a disabled extension may be moved to the top level of your hard disk.  If this happens and you try to turn on the extension in the Extensions Manager control panel, you will not be able to turn it on, even though it appears in the list.  To fix this problem, drag the desired extension  into the “Extensions (Disabled)” folder  (in the System Folder) before using the Extensions Manager.Daystar Accelerator CardsIf you have a Power Macintosh Upgrade Card and a Daystar accelerator card installed, the Power Macintosh Card control panel will be installed, even though it is not applicable to your computer.SAM SAM needs to be 4.0.8 or later, which is also true for System 7.5.2.PowerBook-related problems• If you have a PowerBook 190 with Open Transport active and are using the IR port,  networking may not work after you restart the computer. Try putting the computer to sleep and waking it up, or choosing the printer/modem port and then switching back to the IR port.•  If you are making disks from the disk images included on the CD, they may not work correctly with  PowerBook 5300 and 190 series computers.  To use such disks on a PowerBook 5300 or 190 series computer, make sure you make the disks on that computer.   •  If you copy the Installer to a PowerBook, and then use that PowerBook in SCSI disk mode to install System 7.5.3 on another computer, it will install the appropriate system software for the computer your PowerBook is connected to in SCSI disk mode, not for the PowerBook.DOS-compatible-related problems•  On DOS-compatible computers, CD-ROM Setup version 5.0.4 or later does not recognize DOS-formatted CDs, unless the CD is inserted in the computer when you turn the computer on.• When used with SerialDMA, DOS Compatibility software will not be able to use hardware handshaking on the PC serial port.CD-ROM related problems• You may have problems starting your computer from the System 7.5, Version 7.5.3 CD, or mounting the CD on your computer if you have an older computer, an older CD-ROM drive, or a non-Apple CD-ROM drive.  If this happens, try starting up from the appropriate Disk Tools disk, then reinsert the CD, and install the software from the CD.• To eject the CD-ROM, drag its icon to the trash.  The CD should eject automatically from the CD-ROM drive when you restart your computer.  If this does not happen, turn off the computer and manually eject the CD. • Digital audio recording and playback can occasionally “skip” if virtual memory is turned on. To reduce this skipping, turn off virtual memory.© 1996  Apple Computer, Inc.
